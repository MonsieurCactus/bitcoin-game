In this game learn about differences in currency between Bitcoin, US Dollar and the Euro.
In this case, all 3 currencies are stable, but small differences could amount to large profit.

In this game, we explore the idea that Bitcoin is an accetable currency, just like the Dollar, the Peso or the Yen.  Maybe even without the problems that other currencies have.
