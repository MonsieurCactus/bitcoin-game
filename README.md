In this game learn about differences in currency between Bitcoin, US Dollar and the Euro.
In this case, all 3 currencies are stable, but small differences could amount to large profit.

In this game, we explore the idea that Bitcoin is an accetable currency, just like the Dollar, the Peso or the Yen.  Maybe even without the problems that other currencies have.

This project also served as an introduction to the [Go](https://www.golang-book.com/books/intro) programming language and the [Martini](http://codecondo.com/4-minimal-web-frameworks-go-golang/) web framework.

The Go programming language is growing in popularity.  It was developed by the company Google.  It is perfect for concurrent tasks ( many users approaching a task at the same time), and works the same way regardless of the different computer you may have (IBM, Mac, Android, iOS, Samsung, LG, Lenovo, ...)
